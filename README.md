# ⚡ clubTivi

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for Android, macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Why clubTivi?

Most IPTV players let you watch one provider at a time. When a stream buffers, you're stuck. And your free channels, paid services, and debrids are all in separate apps. clubTivi changes that — it **brings everything into one interface** and **automatically switches streams** when problems are detected. No more buffering. No more app-hopping. No more manually hunting for a working channel.

## ✨ Features

### ⚡ Smart Channels
The headline feature that sets clubTivi apart. Group the same channel from multiple sources — free TV, paid services, debrids — into a single **Smart Channel**:

- **One-click creation** — multi-select matching channels, hit "New Smart Channel"
- **Automatic failover** — when buffering is detected, instantly switches to the next healthy stream
- **Mix any source** — combine free, paid, and debrid streams for the same channel in one group
- **Priority ordering** — arrange streams in your preferred order; the best source plays first
- **Full EPG integration** — Smart Channels show the same guide data as regular channels
- **Visual indicators** — amber ⚡ bolt icon, playing-stream highlight, expand to see all members
- **Right-click management** — rename, delete, remove members, add channels to existing groups

### 📺 EPG (Electronic Program Guide)
- **4-tier intelligent auto-matching** — explicit mapping → tvgId lookup → normalized name match → call-sign extraction (WABC, WCBS, etc.)
- **Full timeline guide view** — horizontally scrollable multi-day programme grid with now-playing highlight
- **EPG for Smart Channels** — guide data pulls from the best-matched member automatically
- **XMLTV support** — load EPG from any URL or local file
- **Compatible with EPG providers** like epg.best and others
- **Now-playing text** on every channel row — see what's on without opening the guide

### 🔄 Multi-Provider Management
- **Unlimited providers** — add free TV (Pluto TV, etc.), paid IPTV services, debrids, and more
- **One unified interface** — all sources merge into one searchable, filterable channel list
- **Provider badges** — see which provider each stream comes from at a glance
- **324K+ channels tested** — handles massive playlists with instant startup via phased loading

### ⭐ Favorites & Organization
- **Multiple favorite lists** — create custom lists (Sports, News, Movies, etc.)
- **Sidebar navigation** — browse by provider group, favorite list, or "All Channels"
- **Smart search** — real-time filtering with debounced search across all channels
- **Vanity names** — rename any channel without affecting the underlying data
- **Channel history** — backspace to toggle between current and previous channel

### 🎮 Keyboard & Remote Control
- **Full keyboard navigation** — arrow keys, Enter for fullscreen, number keys for direct channel entry
- **Volume control** — left/right arrow keys adjust volume with visual overlay
- **D-pad optimized** — Android TV remote and gamepad support with focus-based navigation
- **Multi-select** — Shift+click or Cmd+click to select multiple channels for batch operations
- **Debug dialog** — press `D` to see stream details, EPG mapping, provider info, and failover alternatives

### 🖥️ Player & Playback
- **media_kit** powered — libmpv/FFmpeg backend for broad codec support
- **Fullscreen mode** — double-click or press Enter to toggle
- **Preview row** — see a live preview of the selected channel before committing
- **Info overlay** — channel name, EPG now-playing, and provider shown on channel switch
- **Multi-audio track support** — handles streams with multiple audio tracks (EAC-3, AAC, etc.)

### 🚀 Performance
- **Instant startup** — favorites and providers load first (Phase 0), everything else loads in background
- **Phased loading** — splash screen → favorites → sidebar groups → EPG → full channel list
- **Lazy EPG loading** — guide data fetched only for visible/favorite channels first
- **Efficient logo caching** — channel logos load once and persist across sessions
- **Session persistence** — remembers your last channel, scroll position, and sidebar state

- For Android: Android Studio + Android SDK
- For macOS: Xcode 15+
- For Linux: `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `pkg-config`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libmpv-dev`
- For Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop development workload

### Build & Run

```

**Key design decisions:**
- **Single-screen architecture** — channels, guide, search, and Smart Channels all live in `channels_screen.dart` for instant navigation
- **Phased startup** — favorites render in <1s, full channel list loads incrementally in background
- **Smart Channel groups** stored in SQLite (`failover_groups` + `failover_group_channels` tables) with in-memory index for O(1) lookups
- **EPG matching** runs 4 tiers of heuristics so channels match guide data without manual configuration
